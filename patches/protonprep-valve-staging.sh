    # kernel32-CopyFileEx - breaks various installers
    # dbghelp-Debug_Symbols - Ubisoft Connect games (3/3 I had installed and could test) will crash inside pe_load_debug_info function with this enabled
    # version-VerQueryValue - just a test and doesn't apply cleanly. not relevant for gaming
    # mf_http_support - disabled in favor of custom ffmpeg backend video playback solution
